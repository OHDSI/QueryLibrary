# G07: Find concepts that have a relationship with a given concept

## Description
For a concept identifier entered as the input parameter, the query lists all existing relationships with other concepts. The resulting output includes:
- Type of relationship (including both relationship ID and description)
- Details of the other concept to which the relationship has been defined
- Polarity of the relationship
  - Polarity of "Relates to" implies the input concept is the first concept or CONCEPT_ID_1 of the relationship
  - Polarity of "Is Related by" implies the input concept is the second concept or CONCEPT_ID_2 of the relationship

In vocabulary Version 4.0 and above all relationships are bi-directional, ie. all relationships are repeated as a mirrored version, where CONCEPT_ID_1 and CONCEPT_ID_2 are swapped and the inverse relationship ID is provided.

## Query
```sql
SELECT
  'Relates to'         AS relationship_polarity,
  cr.relationship_id   AS relationship_id,
  d.concept_id         AS concept_id,
  d.concept_name       AS concept_name,
  d.concept_code       AS concept_code,
  d.concept_class_id   AS concept_class_id,
  d.vocabulary_id      AS concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS a ON cr.concept_id_1 = a.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS d ON cr.concept_id_2 = d.concept_id
WHERE 
  a.concept_id = 192671 AND
  cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
  
UNION ALL

SELECT
  'Is related by'      AS relationship_polarity,
  cr.relationship_id   AS relationship_id,
  a.concept_id         AS concept_id,
  a.concept_name       AS concept_name,
  a.concept_code       AS concept_code,
  a.concept_class_id   AS concept_class_id,
  a.vocabulary_id      AS concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS a ON cr.concept_id_1 = a.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS d ON cr.concept_id_2 = d.concept_id
WHERE 
  d.concept_id = 192671 AND
  cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Concept ID |  192671 |  Yes | Gastrointestinal hemorrhage |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Relationship_Polarity |  Polarity of the relationship with the input concept as a reference. "Relates to" indicates input concept is CONCEPT_ID_1 or the first concept of the relationship. "Is Related by" indicates input concept |
|  Relationship_ID |  Identifier for the type of relationship |
|  Concept_ID |  Unique identifier of the concept related to the input concept |
|  Concept_Name |  Name of the concept related to the input concept |
|  Concept_Code |  Concept code of concept related to the input concept |
|  concept_class_id |  Concept Class of concept related to the input concept |
|  Concept_Vocab_ID |  ID of the vocabulary the related concept is derived from |

## Example output record

|  Field |  Value |
| --- | --- |
|  Relationship_Polarity |  Is Related to |
|  Relationship_ID |  MedDRA - SNOMED eq |
|  Concept_ID |  35707864 |
|  Concept_Name |  Gastrointestinal haemorrhage |
