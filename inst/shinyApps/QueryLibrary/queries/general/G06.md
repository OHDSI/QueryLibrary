# G06: Find concepts and their descendants that are covered by a given source code

## Description
This query returns all concepts that are direct maps and the descendants of these directly mapped concepts. This is useful if the target standard vocabulary is organized in a tall hierarchy, while the source vocabulary organization is flat.

Additional constraints can be added at the end of the query if only a specific target domain or target vocabulary is desired. For example, if only SNOMED-CT as the standard vocabulary for conditions needs be returned, the target vocabulary can be set to 1.

In the query only FDB indications and contraindications are returned, but not NDF-RT indications or contraindications. That is because no direct mapping between ICD-9-CM and NDF-RT exists. In order to query for drug indications please see queries D12 through D18.

## Query
```sql
WITH dm AS ( -- collect direct maps
    SELECT
      c1.concept_code     AS source_code,
      c1.vocabulary_id    AS source_vocabulary_id,
      c1.domain_id        AS source_domain_id,
      c2.concept_id       AS target_concept_id,
      c2.concept_name     AS target_concept_name,
      c2.concept_code     AS target_concept_code,
      c2.concept_class_id AS target_concept_class_id,
      c2.vocabulary_id    AS target_concept_vocab_id
    FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
      JOIN @vocab.concept AS c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
      JOIN @vocab.concept AS c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
    WHERE
      cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to' AND
      c1.concept_code IN ('410.0') AND
      c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD9CM' AND
      cr.invalid_reason IS NULL
)
SELECT
  dm.source_code,
  dm.source_vocabulary_id,
  dm.source_domain_id,
  dc.concept_id       AS target_concept_id,
  dc.concept_name     AS target_concept_name,
  dc.concept_code     AS target_concept_code,
  dc.concept_class_id AS target_concept_class_id,
  dc.vocabulary_id    AS target_concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_ancestor AS ca -- collect descendants which includes ancestor itself
  JOIN dm ON ca.ancestor_concept_id = dm.target_concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS dc ON ca.descendant_concept_id = dc.concept_id
WHERE dc.standard_concept = 'S'
