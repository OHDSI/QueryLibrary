```sql
SELECT
  cr.relationship_id  AS relationship_id,
  c1.vocabulary_id    AS from_vocabulary_id,
  c1.concept_class_id AS from_concept_class_id,
  c2.vocabulary_id    AS to_vocabulary_id,
  c2.concept_class_id AS to_concept_class_id,
  COUNT(*)            AS num_records
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
GROUP BY
  cr.relationship_id,
  c1.vocabulary_id,
  c1.concept_class_id,
  c2.vocabulary_id,
  c2.concept_class_id
ORDER BY
  cr.relationship_id,
  c1.concept_class_id
;
```
