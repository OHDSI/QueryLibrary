# G14: Statistics about relationships between concepts

## Description
This query produces list and frequency of all relationships between concepts (Standard and non-standard) and their class

## Query
```sql
SELECT
  R.relationship_id,
  R.relationship_name,
  C1.vocabulary_id from_vocabulary_id,
  V1.vocabulary_name from_vocabulary_name,
  C1.concept_class_id from_concept_class,
  C2.vocabulary_id to_vocabulary_id,
  V2.vocabulary_name to_vocabulary_name,
  C2.concept_class_id to_concept_class,
  count(*) num_records
FROM
  @vocab.concept_relationship CR,
  @vocab.concept C1,
  @vocab.concept C2,
  @vocab.relationship R,
  @vocab.vocabulary V1,
  @vocab.vocabulary V2
WHERE
  CR.concept_id_1 = C1.concept_id AND
  CR.concept_id_2 = C2.concept_id AND
  R.relationship_id = CR.relationship_id AND
  C1.vocabulary_id = V1.vocabulary_id AND
  C2.vocabulary_id = V2.vocabulary_id
GROUP BY
  R.relationship_id,
  relationship_name,
  C1.vocabulary_id,
  V1.vocabulary_name,
  C1.concept_class_id,
  C2.vocabulary_id,
  V2.vocabulary_name,
  C2.concept_class_id
ORDER BY
  R.relationship_id,
  C1.concept_class_id;
```
