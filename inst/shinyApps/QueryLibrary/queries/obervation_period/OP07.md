# OP07: Distribution of age across all observation period records

## Description
Count distribution of age across all observation period records:  the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH age_distribution AS 
  ( SELECT 
      DISTINCT u.person_id, 
      YEAR(first_observation_date) - year_of_birth AS age
    FROM -- person, first observation date
    ( SELECT 
        person_id,
        MIN(observation_period_start_date) AS first_observation_date
      FROM @cdm.observation_period
      GROUP BY person_id
    ) AS u
    INNER JOIN @cdm.person 
    ON u.person_id = person.person_id
    WHERE year_of_birth IS NOT NULL
  ) 
SELECT 
  COUNT(*)                                                                      AS num_people,
  min( age )                                                                    AS min_age,
  max( age )                                                                    AS max_age,
  round( avg( age ), 2 )                                                        AS avg_age,
  round( STDEV( age ), 1 )                                                      AS stdev_age,
    ROUND(STDEV(age), 1)                                                        AS STDEV_value,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE age END)      AS percentile_25,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE age END)      AS median_age,
    MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE age END)      AS percentile_75

FROM 
 ( SELECT 
     age                                                     AS age,
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age)                        AS order_nr,
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM age_distribution ) AS population_size
   FROM age_distribution
 ) ordered_data;
```
