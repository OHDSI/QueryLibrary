# OP11: Distribution of observation period end dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for observation period end dates (observation_period_end_date) across all observation period records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH op AS
  (SELECT
      DATEDIFF(day,DATEFROMPARTS(1900,1,1),observation_period_end_date) diffs,
      CAST(CONVERT(VARCHAR, observation_period_end_date, 112) AS INTEGER) AS end_date,
	  COUNT(*)OVER() AS population_size
   FROM @cdm.observation_period
  )
SELECT
  CONVERT(DATE, CAST( min(end_date) AS VARCHAR ))                                                                    AS min_end_date,
  CONVERT(DATE, CAST( max(end_date) AS VARCHAR ))                                                                    AS max_end_date,
  DATEADD(day, ROUND(AVG(CAST(diffs AS BIGINT)),1), DATEFROMPARTS(1900,1,1)) AS avg_end_date,
  round( STDEV( end_date ), 1 )                                                                                      AS STDEV_days ,
  CONVERT(DATE, CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR))  AS percentile_25,
  CONVERT(DATE, CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR))  AS median,
  CONVERT(DATE, CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR))  AS percentile_75

FROM
 ( SELECT
     diffs,
	 end_date                                                     AS end_date,
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY end_date)                        AS order_nr,
     population_size
   FROM op
 ) ordered_data;
```
