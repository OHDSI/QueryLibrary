# OP08: Distribution of observation period records per person

## Description
Counts the number of observation period records (observation_period_id) for all persons: 
the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, 
the maximum and the number of missing values. There is no input required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH obser_person AS
  ( SELECT
      observation_period.person_id,
      COUNT(*) AS observation_periods
    FROM @cdm.observation_period
    INNER JOIN @cdm.person 
    ON observation_period.person_id = person.person_id
    GROUP BY observation_period.person_id
  )

SELECT 
  MIN( observation_periods )                                                              AS min_periods ,
  MAX( observation_periods )                                                              AS max_periods ,
  round( avg( observation_periods ), 2 )                                                  AS avg_periods ,
  round( STDEV( observation_periods ), 1 )                                                AS STDEV_periods ,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE observation_periods END)  AS percentile_25,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE observation_periods END)  AS median,
  MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN 9999 ELSE observation_periods END)  AS percentile_75

FROM 
 ( SELECT 
     observation_periods                                                     AS observation_periods,
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY observation_periods)                        AS order_nr,
     (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM obser_person )                                    AS population_size
   FROM obser_person
 ) ordered_data;
```
