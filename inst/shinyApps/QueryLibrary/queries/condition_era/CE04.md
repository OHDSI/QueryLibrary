# CE04: Conditions, stratified by year, age group and gender

## Description
This query is used to count conditions (condition_concept_id) across all condition era records stratified by year, age group and gender (gender_concept_id). The age groups are calculated as 10 year age bands from the age of a person at the condition era start date. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a condition_concept_id , year, age_group (10 year age band) and gender_concept_id. If the input is ommitted, all existing value combinations are summarized..
