# CE03: Min/max, average length of condition stratified by age/gender

## Description
Calculates the min, max, and average lenght of a condition and stratifies by age and gender.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in blue

```sql
WITH hip_fracture  AS (
SELECT DISTINCT ca.descendant_concept_id
  FROM @vocab.concept c
  JOIN @vocab.concept_ancestor ca
    ON ca.ancestor_concept_id = c.concept_id
 WHERE c.concept_code = '359817006'
), people_with_hip_fracture AS (
SELECT DISTINCT
       p.person_id,
       c.concept_name AS gender,
       YEAR(ce.condition_era_start_date) - p.year_of_birth AS age,
       DATEDIFF(d,ce.condition_era_start_date,ce.condition_era_end_date) + 1 AS duration,
       (YEAR(ce.condition_era_start_date) - p.year_of_birth)/10 AS age_grp
  FROM @cdm.condition_era ce
  JOIN hip_fracture hf  
    ON hf.descendant_concept_id = ce.condition_concept_id

         WHEN age_grp = 9 THEN '90-99'
         WHEN age_grp > 9 THEN '100+'
       END           AS age_grp,
       COUNT(*)      AS num_patients,
       MIN(duration) AS min_duration_count,

 GROUP BY gender, age_grp
 ORDER BY gender, age_grp;
