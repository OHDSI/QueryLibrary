# CE13: Distribution of condition occurrence count

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for condition occurrence counts (condition_occurrence_count) across all condition era records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue

```sql
WITH count_data AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id, COUNT(*) AS condition_occurrence_count
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
 WHERE condition_concept_id IN ( 256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 )
 GROUP BY condition_concept_id
), ordered_data AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id, condition_occurrence_count,
       ROW_NUMBER()OVER(ORDER BY condition_occurrence_count) AS order_nr
  FROM count_data
)
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       condition_occurrence_count,
       MIN(condition_occurrence_count)over() AS min_count,
       MAX(condition_occurrence_count)over() AS max_count,
       AVG(condition_occurrence_count)over() AS avg_count,
       ROUND(STDEV(condition_occurrence_count)over(),0) AS stdev_count,
       MAX(CASE WHEN order_nr = 2 then condition_occurrence_count else 0 END)OVER() AS percentile_25,
       MAX(CASE WHEN order_nr = 3 then condition_occurrence_count else 0 END)OVER() AS median,
       MAX(CASE WHEN order_nr = 4 then condition_occurrence_count else 0 END)OVER() AS percentile_75
  FROM ordered_data;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| list of condition_concept_id |  256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 | No |   |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
| condition_concept_id | The concept ID of the condition |
| condition_occurrence_count | The number of occurrences of the condition |
| min_count | The minimum number of condition era's of the condition |
| max_count | The maximum number of condition era's of the condition |
| avg_count | The average number of condition era's of the condition |
| stdev_count | The standard deviation of the number of condition era's of the condition |
| percentile_25 | The 25th percentile of the number of condition era's of the condition |
| median | The median of the number of condition era's of the condition |
| percentile_75 | The 75th percentile of the number of condition era's of the condition |
