# CE05: Conditions that are seasonally dependent

## Description
This query is used to count conditions (condition_concept_id) across all condition era records stratified by year, age group and gender (gender_concept_id). The age groups are calculated as 10 year age bands from the age of a person at the condition era start date. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a condition_concept_id , year, age_group (10 year age band) and gender_concept_id. If the input is ommitted, all existing value combinations are summarized..

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in blue

```sql
WITH asthma AS (
SELECT DISTINCT c2.concept_id AS snomed_asthma
  FROM @vocab.concept c1
  JOIN @vocab.concept_relationship cr
    ON c1.concept_id = cr.concept_id_1
   AND cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to'
  JOIN @vocab.concept c2
    ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept_ancestor ca
    ON ca.ancestor_concept_id = c2.concept_id   
 WHERE c1.concept_code LIKE '493.0%'
)
SELECT season, COUNT(*) AS cases
  FROM (
SELECT CASE WHEN MONTH(ce.condition_era_start_date) IN (12,1,2)
            THEN 'Winter'

	        WHEN MONTH(ce.condition_era_start_date) IN (3,4,5)
            THEN 'Spring'

	        WHEN MONTH(ce.condition_era_start_date) IN (6,7,8)
            THEN 'Summer'

	        WHEN MONTH(ce.condition_era_start_date) IN (9,10,11)
            THEN 'Fall'
       END AS season
  FROM @cdm.condition_era ce
  JOIN asthma a
    ON a.snomed_asthma = ce.condition_concept_id
       ) TMP
 GROUP BY season;
```
