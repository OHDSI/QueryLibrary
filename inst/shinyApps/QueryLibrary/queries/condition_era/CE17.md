# CE17: Distribution of condition occurrence count, stratified by condition and condition type

## Description
This query is used to provide summary statistics for condition occurrence count (condition_occurrence_count) across all condition era records stratified by condition (condition_concept_id) and condition type (condition_type_concept_id, in CDM V2 condition_occurrence_type): the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. The input to the query is a value (or a comma-separated list of values) of a condition_concept_id and a condition_type_concept_id. If the input is omitted, all existing value combinations are summarized.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query. The input parameters are highlighted in  blue

```sql
WITH count_data AS (
SELECT DISTINCT
       ce.condition_concept_id,
       co.condition_type_concept_id,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY ce.condition_concept_id, ce.person_id) AS occurrences
  FROM @cdm.condition_era ce
  JOIN @cdm.condition_occurrence co
    ON ce.condition_concept_id = co.condition_concept_id
   AND ce.person_id            = co.person_id
 WHERE ce.condition_concept_id IN ( 256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 )
), ordered_data AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,condition_type_concept_id,occurrences,
       ROW_NUMBER()OVER(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id ORDER BY occurrences) AS order_nr,
       COUNT(*)OVER(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS population_size
  FROM count_data
)
SELECT DISTINCT
       condition_concept_id,
       condition_type_concept_id,
       MIN(occurrences)over(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS min_count,
       MAX(occurrences)over(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS max_count,
       AVG(occurrences)over(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS avg_count,
       ROUND(STDEV(occurrences)over(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id),0) AS stdev_count,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size then 9999999999 else occurrences END)OVER(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS percentile_25,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size then 9999999999 else occurrences END)OVER(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS median,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size then 9999999999 else occurrences END)OVER(PARTITION BY condition_type_concept_id) AS percentile_75
  FROM ordered_data
 ORDER BY condition_type_concept_id, condition_concept_id;
```

## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| list of condition_concept_id |  256723, 372906, 440377, 441202, 435371 | No |   |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
| condition_concept_id | The concept ID of the condition |
| condition_type_concept_id | The concept ID of the type of the condition |
| min_count | The minimum number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| max_count | The maximum number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| avg_count | The average number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| stdev_count | The standard deviation of the number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| percentile_25 | The 25th percentile of the number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| median | The median of the number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
| percentile_75 | The 75th percentile of the number of occurrences of the condition per condition type per person |
