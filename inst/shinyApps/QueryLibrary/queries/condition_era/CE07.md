```sql
WITH snomed_diabetes AS (
SELECT ca.descendant_concept_id AS snomed_diabetes_id
  FROM @vocab.concept c
  JOIN @vocab.concept_ancestor ca
    ON ca.ancestor_concept_id = c.concept_id
 WHERE c.concept_code = '73211009'
),  people_with_diabetes AS (
SELECT ce.person_id,
       MIN(ce.condition_era_start_date) AS onset_date
  FROM @cdm.condition_era ce
  JOIN snomed_diabetes sd
    ON sd.snomed_diabetes_id = ce.condition_concept_id
 GROUP BY ce.person_id
), non_diabetic AS (
SELECT person_id,
       condition_concept_id,
       condition_era_start_date
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
 WHERE condition_concept_id NOT IN (SELECT snomed_diabetes_id FROM snomed_diabetes)
)
SELECT c.concept_name AS comorbidity,
       COUNT(DISTINCT diabetic.person_id) AS frequency        
  FROM people_with_diabetes diabetic
  JOIN non_diabetic comorb
	ON comorb.person_id = diabetic.person_id
   AND comorb.condition_era_start_date > diabetic.onset_date
  JOIN @vocab.concept c
    ON c.concept_id = comorb.condition_concept_id
 GROUP BY c.concept_name
 ORDER BY frequency DESC;
