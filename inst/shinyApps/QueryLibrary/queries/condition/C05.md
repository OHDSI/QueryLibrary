# C05: Translate a source code to condition concepts

## Description
This query enables to search all Standard SNOMED-CT concepts that are mapped to a condition (disease) source code. It can be used to translate e.g. ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM or Read codes to SNOMED-CT.

Source codes are not unique across different source vocabularies, therefore the source vocabulary ID must also be provided.

The following source vocabularies have condition/disease codes that map to SNOMED-CT concepts:

- ICD-9-CM
- Read
- OXMIS
- ICD-10-CM

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list SNOMED-CT concepts that a set of mapped codes entered as input map to.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c1.concept_code     AS source_code,
  c1.concept_name     AS source_name,
  c1.vocabulary_id    AS source_vocabulary_id,
  c2.concept_id       AS target_concept_id,
  c2.concept_name     AS target_concept_name,
  c2.concept_code     AS target_concept_code,
  c2.concept_class_id AS target_concept_class,
  c2.vocabulary_id    AS target_concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE
  cr.relationship_id = 'Maps to' AND
  c1.concept_code IN ('070.0') AND
  c1.vocabulary_id = 'ICD9CM' AND
  c1.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  Source Code List |  '070.0' |  Yes | Source codes are alphanumeric and need to be entered as a string enclosed by a single quote. If more than one source code needs to be entered an IN clause or a JOIN can be used. |
|  Source Vocabulary ID |  'ICD9CM' |  Yes | The source vocabulary is mandatory, because the source ID is not unique across different vocabularies. |


## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Source_Code |  Source code for the disease entered as input |
|  Source_Name |  Name of the source code entered as input |
|  Source_Vocabulary_ID |  Vocabulary the disease source code is derived from as vocabulary ID |
|  Target_Concept_ID |  Concept ID of the target condition concept mapped to the disease source code |
|  Target_Concept_Name |  Name of the target condition concept mapped to the disease source code |
|  Target_Concept_Code |  Concept code of the target condition concept mapped to the disease source code |
|  Target_Concept_Class |  Concept class of the target condition concept mapped to the disease source code |
|  Target_Concept_Vocab_ID |  Vocabulary the target condition concept is derived from as vocabulary code |

## Example output record

|  Field |  Value |
| --- | --- |
|  Source_Code |  070.0 |
|  Source_Name |  Viral hepatitis |
|  Source_Vocabulary_ID |  ICD9CM |
|  Target_Concept_ID |  4291005 |
|  Target_Concept_Name |  VH - Viral hepatitis |
|  Target_Concept_Code |  3738000 |
|  Target_Concept_Class |  Clinical finding |
|  Target_Concept_Vocab_ID |  SNOMED |
