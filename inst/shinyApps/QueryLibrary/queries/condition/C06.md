# C06: Translate a given condition to source codes

## Description
This query allows to search all source codes that are mapped to a SNOMED-CT clinical finding concept. It can be used to translate SNOMED-CT to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CM, Read or OXMIS codes.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to list all source codes that map to a SNOMED-CT concept entered as input.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c1.concept_code     AS source_code,
  c1.concept_name     AS source_name,
  c1.vocabulary_id    AS source_vocabulary_id,
  c1.domain_id        AS source_domain_id,
  c2.concept_id       AS target_concept_id,
  c2.concept_name     AS target_concept_name,
  c2.concept_code     AS target_concept_code,
  c2.concept_class_id AS target_concept_class,
  c2.vocabulary_id    AS target_concept_vocab_id
FROM @vocab.concept_relationship AS cr
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c1 ON cr.concept_id_1 = c1.concept_id
  JOIN @vocab.concept AS c2 ON cr.concept_id_2 = c2.concept_id
WHERE
  cr.relationship_id = 'Mapped from' AND
  c1.concept_id = 312327 AND
  c2.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
## Input

|  Parameter |  Example |  Mandatory |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  SNOMED-CT Concept ID |  312327 |  Yes | Concept IDs are numeric. If more than one concept needs to be translated an IN clause or a JOIN can be used. |

## Output

|  Field |  Description |
| --- | --- |
|  Source_Code |  Source code for the disease entered as input |
|  Source_Name |  Name of the source code entered as input |
|  Source_Vocabulary_ID |  Vocabulary the disease source code is derived from as vocabulary code |
|  Source_Domain_ID |  Type of mapping or mapping domain, from source code to target concept. Example Condition, Procedure, Drug etc. |
|  Target_Concept_ID |  Concept ID of the SNOMED-CT concept entered as input |
|  Target_Concept_Name |  Name of the SNOMED-CT concept entered as input |
|  Target_Concept_Code |  Concept code of the SNOMED-CT concept entered as input |
|  Target_Concept_Class |  Concept class of the SNOMED-CT concept entered as input |
|  Target_Concept_Vocab_ID |  Vocabulary of concept entered as input is derived from, as vocabulary ID |

## Example output record

|  Field |  Value |
| --- | --- |
|  Source_Code |  57054005 |
|  Source_Name |  Acute myocardial infarction |
|  Source_Vocabulary_ID |  SNOMED |
|  Source_Domain_ID |  CONDITION |
|  Target_Concept_ID |  44820861 |
|  Target_Concept_Name | Acute myocardial infarction, unspecified site, subsequent episode of care  |
|  Target_Concept_Code | 410.92  |
|  Target_Concept_Class |  5-dig billing code |
|  Target_Concept_Vocab_ID |  ICD9CM |
